This is GP
================

We are some highschoolers from Bulgaria who have an idea and spirit, and also we can code.
The webpage at which you can view the project is http://uvkk8e51549f.venom1724.koding.io/

Although we are still in highschool, we have experience in programming and developing in many languages and platforms.
This is our first time at event like this, but we are ready and hopefully we can participate.

Theme: Problems facing our planet, explained using interactive data visualization. We will focus in using an API to gather data about different problematics we're (as humanity) facing in this moment. We're going to try to do so in a simpler manner, so everyone can read clearly what's going on.

We aim to build an utility that's going to be useful to millions of people every day, it could be used to warn from upcoming danger and even save people's lives.

About GP
===============================

GP is a real-time map illustrating sea currents and giving information from bouys to the web. There are tsunami stations on the map that alert if they are in event mode. In fact, this information can be used by every internet user.These tsunami stations can warn people if danger is approaching via our website. We are planning to do a few more upgrades if it's possible.

Features
=================================
Because of the used Google maps Api v3 it has some features that google maps also do have.The first one is street view also zoom in and zoom out options.It has animated particles of the sea currents.It's drawn with moving arrows and two colours- red and blue(red is for the warm currents and blue for the cold ones) that shows the direction of each of them. Most of the bouys that we get information from are represented on the map with an icon looking just like a bouy and stack up if they are more on a smaller area. And the last one can be life-saving - the tsunami warning - It warns if a region is in danger of tsunami.
